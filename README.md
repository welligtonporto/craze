## Technical definitions
Basically, this project was developed with the technologies HTML5, CSS3 (with Sass/Compass) and pure Javascript.

For construct de UI, i used as base a Framework developed by me in my actual company and I made the necessary changes for this project.

The CSS follow the [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) methodology for construct the components and [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) to name them well.

For import the icons, i used the [Fontello](http://fontello.com/) - an online tool with many ready icons options and also have option of upload custom icons (it is very good).

The unique dependency of project are [two fonts on Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/selection?query=roboto&selection.family=Pacifico|Roboto:400,700).

For help me in development, i used the [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) for make compile files, validate the code and others.

## New features (soon)
- CSS Animations
- Changes on JS Carousel:
  - Enable tap function for mobile navigation
  - Create navigation dots dynamically
